# two-player-pong
Creates a basic single player Pong game - work in progress

Currently contains unreachable code, planned to be fixed in a future update
- unreachable code fixed, not committed

- in the process of updating the code to have a new window instead of showing in terminal
- this broke the win condition, fixing
- when perfectly colliding with the ball at the top/bottom of the racket, the ball bugs out
- implement ball acceleration
